To achieve this tough goal I knew that I needed to look all over to find and sometimes create opportunities. Many of the best opportunities are not posted on job boards and require hard work/networking for one to uncover them. I was fortunate enough to be connected with Sharyn Outtrim back in 2010. Soon after we met, I was fortunate to get the opportunity to gain professional experience working with her at the 2010 Final Four. Using that as a springboard, I was able to work with Sharyn at numerous events until I graduated from college in 2012.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">Whether I am speaking in a class at Indiana or casually talking with students at various professional events, I always let them know how lucky I was to have such great work experiences and the importance of utilizing all of your resources to create your own opportunities. Many students do not get work experience because they only look for posted internships or formal opportunities, but very few go seek out other opportunities or ways to gain valuable knowledge and experience. It is so important to get yourself out there and just ask for the opportunities to work/learn through volunteering or at networking events. The skills I gained from my experiences prepared me for the next steps in my life through job interviews and eventually full-time employment.
